# My To-Do List Application
An application created using JavaScript that allows users to add list items, edit, delete and complete them.

### This application allows users to track their current day's tasks. They can add, delete, edit, or complete any list item.

## WORKING
1. My todo list allows users to add, edit, delete and set tasks for the day. 
2. Additionaly users can also choose to complete the tasks by clicking the "check" icon. 
3. As a design feature, users can toggle between light and dark modes as well. 
4. Other functionality includes- filtering, and clearing tasks from the list. The todo lists are stored in the local storage, so that users don't lose out on their tasks and progress!

## My Learnings
- The major takeaway from this project was ***splitting the problems into sub-problems***, and then building a complete, working todo list from all the components. 
- Event delegation was another concept I got to learn and use in this project. 
- Managing, adding, clearing local storage was a learning.

## Challenges
- Designing the overall application was incredibly challenging.
- Taking into account responsiveness across all devices was one of the major goals for this project.
- Editing a previously added todo item was another challenge. More so, to change the same todo item from the local storage as well.
